# AI-DCOP-Problem
This project (in collaboration with Anat Ben-Haim) is an Artificial Intelligence DCOP problem solution using two algorithms: MGM-2 and DSA-C.
Both algorithms were tested for a range of different probabilities for nodes to be constrained.
DSA was set to a "hard-coded" value change under a probability of 0.7 (for exploration-exploitation balance).
MGM-2 was set to perform 1000 iterations until convergence.

The project was made in Python.
